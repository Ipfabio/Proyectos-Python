# ttkboostrap is use to make tkinter python applications looks "modern" in a simple way.
In the first example, we create a contact_info by applying the theme as stated in the documentation (superhero in my case), and we put two txtfields, one for the email and another for the name, a checkbox to remember the information, and two buttons, one for success and another for cancel.
